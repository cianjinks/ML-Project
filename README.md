# Machine Learning Project - LoL Match Prediction

This machine learning project explores whether it is possible to predict the outcome of a 5v5 online competitive game of League of Legends based on prior known features/statistics about the players on each team.

Our findings and analysis of results, as well as full project details, is presented in [our report](https://github.com/cianjinks/ML-Project/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20-%20Group%2069%20-%20Project%20Report.pdf).
